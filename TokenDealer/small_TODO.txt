>> Launch TokenDealer microservice : 
open a terminal and point to the TokenDealer.py directory
run command : "python TokenDealer.py 5556"
then the TokenDealer is up and it waits for a message from userApi service and arp service.
Messages form :
1. To ask for a token (from userApi to login): 
  bdd login <PASSWORD>
2. To remove a token (from userApi to logout)
  bdd logout <TOKEN>
3. To check whether a token is valid or not (from arp)
  arp <TOKEN>
  => the answer : "ok" so that it is a valid token ( or "ko" otherwise)
